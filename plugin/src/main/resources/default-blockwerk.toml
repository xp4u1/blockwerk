[lobby]
# Dynamically created lobby servers cannot be pre-registered in velocity.toml.
# Blockwerk automatically handles this by dynamically selecting a lobby server
# whenever a player connects to the proxy.

# If you want to override this behavior and implement your own lobby selection
# logic using a custom Velocity event listener, you can disable this feature.

# Server name selector (regular expression)
#
# Blockwerk registers each Kubernetes pod as a Velocity server using its pod
# name. This regex is used to match which servers should be considered as
# "lobby" servers.
#
# Example: "(lobby|hub)-.*" will match names like:
# - lobby-7685cc994f-2m4zr
# - hub-656875f54-xpm99
